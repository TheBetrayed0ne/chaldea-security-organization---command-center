Amakusa\'s robes blur the lines between bishop and battle tactician—flowing white with crimson trim, laced with occult patterns hiding in symmetry. His expression is calm, confident, almost too composed—like someone who already saw the world end once and has a plan for how it\'ll go better next time. His madness is not overt. It\'s theological.

Martha\'s outfit fuses church vestments with martial practicality—a short tunic, armored gloves, and sandals made for walking over both terrain and egos.

Their body is androgynous, inhumanly symmetrical, clad in radiant robes made of golden filigree and powered armor. Their face is masked behind imperial serenity, their voice echoing with synthesized divinity. They don\'t walk—they float, and when they speak, it\'s not conversation. It\'s edict. Their madness is control: of history, of death, of destiny.

Caren wears an ornate black and crimson ensemble that blends gothic fashion with ecclesiastical aesthetic, her halo cracked, her cross inverted in symbolism but not faith. She smiles sweetly as she inflicts damage—both divine and ironic—and each step is a contradiction between kindness and sadistic joy. Her speech is polite, her tone teasing, but her love is dangerous. Her madness is holy masochism dressed for a Valentine\'s funeral.', stats: { atk: 9284, hp: 12696, str: 'C', end: 'B', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'B', np: 'B+' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Love\'s Agony', rank: 'B+', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Evil', temperament: 'Mischievous', department: 'Religious Support', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Saint'], interactionNotes: 'Holy masochism.', loiteringSpots: ['Chapel'], favoriteFoods: ['Sweets'] } },

Moriarty dresses like a gentleman—crisp coat, subtle clockwork embellishments, a top hat tipped with ironic charm. His smirk is that of a man who beat the system by becoming it. He calls it justice while laughing inside. His cane is both symbol and weapon, and every gesture feels rehearsed, precise. He is the worst possible Ruler—because he knows exactly what rules are for. His madness is logic turned upside down.', stats: { atk: 10477, hp: 14259, str: 'D', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'The Dynamics of an Asteroid', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Evil', temperament: 'Mischievous', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Extreme', operationalTags: ['Mastermind'], interactionNotes: 'Logic upside down.', loiteringSpots: ['Observatory'], favoriteFoods: ['Tea'] } },

She does not weigh good or evil. She measures consequence.', stats: { atk: 9593, hp: 16500, str: 'B', end: 'A', agi: 'B', man: 'A++', lck: 'D', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Gate of Skye', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Balanced', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Command', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Queen'], interactionNotes: 'Measures consequence.', loiteringSpots: ['Throne Room Simulation'], favoriteFoods: ['Ice'] } },

Her hair ripples like seaweed caught in a divine current, and her eyes shimmer with ceremonial detachment—too calm, too knowing. Her weapon isn\'t a blade or staff, but divine consequence in motion. She smiles rarely, and when she does, something somewhere sinks beneath the waves.

Johanna\'s papal attire is ornate and feminine—pure white embroidered with impossible script, her mitre heavy with contradiction. Her face is serene, but behind the calm is a cunning too old to be disbelieved. Every sermon is a razor. Every prayer, a veiled challenge. She speaks truth like someone who forged it herself. Her existence questions reality by existing. Her madness is historical irony, canonized in flesh.', stats: { atk: 9284, hp: 12696, str: 'D', end: 'B', agi: 'C', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'B+' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Papal Forgery', rank: 'B+', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', temperament: 'Pragmatic', department: 'Legal', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Pope'], interactionNotes: 'Historical irony.', loiteringSpots: ['Chapel'], favoriteFoods: ['Wine'] } },

She simply appears, and justice manifests as a battlefield perfectly divided between silence and blood.', stats: { atk: 10477, hp: 14259, str: 'B', end: 'B', agi: 'A', man: 'A', lck: 'B', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Bishamonten\'s Avatar', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Combat', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['War God'], interactionNotes: 'War as sacrament.', loiteringSpots: ['Dojo'], favoriteFoods: ['Sake'] } },
