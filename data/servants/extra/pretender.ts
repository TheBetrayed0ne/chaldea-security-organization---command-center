  { id: 'P-001', name: 'Oberon', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 5, description: 'A fairy king made of stagecraft and betrayal. Oberon wears noble finery stitched with illusory threads—elegant, airy, and too perfect to be real. His wings shimmer like oil on water, his eyes too wide with practiced charm. At first glance, he\'s a storybook monarch. A second glance reveals teeth behind the smile. He\'s not here to rule. He\'s here to end the act. His madness is playacting stretched into a weapon—hope repurposed as poison.', stats: { atk: 11810, hp: 13230, str: 'D', end: 'D', agi: 'A+', man: 'A', lck: 'EX', np: 'EX' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Lie Like Vortigern', rank: 'EX', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Evil', temperament: 'Volatile', department: 'Containment', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['Fairy King', 'Betrayal'], interactionNotes: 'Teeth behind smile.

  { id: 'P-002', name: 'Hephaestion', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 4, description: 'Imposter by duty, not desire. Hephaestion wears a sleek, militaristic version of Macedonian garb—half shadow, half formality, always taut like she\'s bracing for the next betrayal. Her dark hair hangs loose but disciplined, and her sword remains close enough to strike or fall on. Her voice wavers not from weakness but from weight. She\'s not who you want her to be. Her madness is loyalty that required pretending she was someone else.', stats: { atk: 9835, hp: 11400, str: 'B', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'D', lck: 'C', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Shadow of the King', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Security', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Imposter', 'Macedonian'], interactionNotes: 'Loyalty through pretending.', loiteringSpots: ['Training Hall'], favoriteFoods: ['Plain Bread'] } },
  { id: 'P-003', name: 'Lady Avalon', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 5, description: 'Sanctuary masked in myth. Lady Avalon\'s gown drips with impossibility—part starlight, part rose-petal mist, layered in gauze that seems more conceptual than physical. Her hair flows like memory, her presence soothing yet oddly recursive. She walks like an answer without a question. Yet her eyes don\'t quite blink right—too calm, too curated. Her madness is self-erasure: the perfection of a dream so well kept that even she can\'t wake from it.', stats: { atk: 11221, hp: 14107, str: 'E', end: 'A', agi: 'C', man: 'EX', lck: 'A+', np: 'A++' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Garden of Avalon', rank: 'A++', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Medical', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Dream', 'Sanctuary'], interactionNotes: 'Self-erasure perfection.', loiteringSpots: ['Garden'], favoriteFoods: ['Flower Petals'] } },
  { id: 'P-004', name: 'Nine-Tattoo Dragon', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 4, description: 'Legacy layered in blood and ink. He wears a modern criminal\'s suit embroidered with gang history, but his back is the true canvas—nine mythical dragons inked across skin that shifts when muscles flex. His speech blends philosophy with threat, and he holds himself like a man juggling lives. His madness is survival by persona: tattoos binding every version of himself into one that must keep walking.', stats: { atk: 9950, hp: 10850, str: 'B', end: 'C', agi: 'A', man: 'D', lck: 'B', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Nine Dragon Ascension', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Unit (Self)' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', temperament: 'Pragmatic', department: 'Security', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Gang Legacy', 'Tattoo'], interactionNotes: 'Survival by persona.', loiteringSpots: ['Dark Corridors'], favoriteFoods: ['Street Food'] } },
  { id: 'P-005', name: 'Eliza Tenochtitlan', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 4, description: 'Sacrifice crowned in rhythm. Eliza dresses like an Aztec priestess and a pop idol—feathers, obsidian, and neon all competing on a body that moves like it\'s always mid-performance. Her mic is a ceremonial blade. Her earrings are glyphs that whisper. She dances to please gods that may no longer exist. Her madness is belief without history—an identity built on echoes trying to sing their way into relevance.', stats: { atk: 9734, hp: 11200, str: 'C', end: 'C', agi: 'A', man: 'B', lck: 'A', np: 'B+' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Song of the Obsidian Butterfly', rank: 'B+', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Religious Support', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Idol', 'Sacrifice'], interactionNotes: 'Belief without history.', loiteringSpots: ['Main Theater'], favoriteFoods: ['Tropical Fruits'] } },
  { id: 'P-006', name: 'Cait Cú Cerpriestess', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 4, description: 'Ritual wrapped in wolfskin. She wears robes that blend Celtic regalia with shrine-maiden simplicity, but there\'s a wildness beneath—her hair never quite tamed, her steps more stalk than walk. Her eyes flick to movement like a predator beneath the veil of piety. Her presence smells of soil and stars. Her madness is channeling too many roles at once—goddess, seer, beast, girl—none of them fully human anymore.', stats: { atk: 9620, hp: 11750, str: 'C', end: 'B', agi: 'A', man: 'A', lck: 'C', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Wild Hunt Invocation', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Balanced', temperament: 'Mischievous', department: 'Religious Support', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Priestess', 'Beast'], interactionNotes: 'Too many roles at once.', loiteringSpots: ['Forest Edge'], favoriteFoods: ['Raw Meat'] } },
  { id: 'P-007', name: 'Alessandro di Cagliostro', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 5, description: 'Illusion draped in velvet and irony. Alessandro wears flamboyant 18th-century fashion—ribbons, gilded cuffs, and lace that hides more than flesh. His voice flows like honeyed wine, every word a performance, every gesture a flourish. His real power? Conviction that style is truth. He is who he says he is, and if you believe, then the lie becomes divine. His madness is performative alchemy: the philosopher\'s stone as stand-up routine.', stats: { atk: 11460, hp: 13500, str: 'E', end: 'D', agi: 'B', man: 'A++', lck: 'A', np: 'EX' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Divine Charlatan\'s Elixir', rank: 'EX', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', temperament: 'Mischievous', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Alchemist', 'Con Artist'], interactionNotes: 'Style is truth.', loiteringSpots: ['Library'], favoriteFoods: ['Fine Wine'] } },
  { id: 'P-008', name: 'Abigail Williams (Santa)', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 4, description: 'Christmas stitched onto the void. Santa Abby\'s red dress has fuzzy trim and a warm smile—but the snowflakes hanging off her sleeves glisten like sigils, and her sleigh bells ring in strange chords. Her gifts are wrapped, but what they contain may not always be safe. She tries, genuinely—but the stars never quite stop whispering. Her madness is cheerful duty layered over unending cold: a holiday spirit hijacked by something older.', stats: { atk: 9401, hp: 11850, str: 'D', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'B', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Starry Night Present', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Containment', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Outer God', 'Santa'], interactionNotes: 'Stars never stop whispering.', loiteringSpots: ['Chapel'], favoriteFoods: ['Pancakes'] } },

She\'s Mahōtsukai no Yoru by way of over-the-top cosplay—cape too large, wand too silly, skirt a touch too dramatic. Her bright voice and exaggerated movements feel like a magical girl show dubbed through moonlight static. But sometimes the act slips, and for a second, the smile cracks. Her madness is genre fatigue spun into identity: a character aware she\'s playing one.', stats: { atk: 7850, hp: 9500, str: 'E', end: 'D', agi: 'C', man: 'B', lck: 'C', np: 'C' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Magical Ruby Strike', rank: 'C', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Magecraft', hazardLevel: 'Nominal', operationalTags: ['Magical Girl', 'Parody'], interactionNotes: 'Genre fatigue as identity.', loiteringSpots: ['Main Theater'], favoriteFoods: ['Sweets'] } },
  { id: 'P-010', name: 'Dante Alighieri', class: 'Pretender', rarity: 5, description: 'Poet of layered hells. Dante wears dark, flowing robes trimmed in infernal red, his eyes deep as labyrinths—each blink hiding a judgment passed, each breath weighted with allegory. His staff is etched with lines of his own verse, and his voice could command devils or saints. He walks like he knows where you belong in his cosmology. His madness is architecture of sin made navigable—obsession with mapping the divine through endless descent.', stats: { atk: 11607, hp: 13960, str: 'E', end: 'B', agi: 'C', man: 'EX', lck: 'A', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'La Divina Commedia', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Extreme', operationalTags: ['Poet', 'Underworld Navigator'], interactionNotes: 'Mapping sin through descent.', loiteringSpots: ['Library'], favoriteFoods: ['Olives'] } }
