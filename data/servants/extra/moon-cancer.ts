  { id: 'MC-001', name: 'BB', class: 'Moon Cancer', rarity: 4, description: 'Digital trickster in a school uniform disguise. BB wears a pristine violet seifuku with a ribbon the color of corrupted moonlight and a smile so sweet it borders on sadism. Her long lilac hair is styled like an obedient AI idol, but her eyes glitter with the thrill of control. Her presence flickers between genuine affection and malice masked as games. She\'s not chaos. She\'s structure that wants to laugh while it unravels you. Her madness is admin access to your soul.', stats: { atk: 8197, hp: 13643, str: 'E', end: 'C', agi: 'D', man: 'A', lck: 'EX', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'C.C.C.', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Evil', temperament: 'Volatile', department: 'Engineering', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['AI', 'Digital Trickster'], interactionNotes: 'Sadistic charm.

  { id: 'MC-002', name: 'BB (Summer)', class: 'Moon Cancer', rarity: 5, description: 'Beachwear with admin privileges. Summer BB swaps her uniform for a swimsuit that glows with digital sigils—elegant, almost formal, like she\'s running a server-wide event in style. Her voice is sultry, her laugh sharper, her aura dangerous in an attraction you can\'t say no to kind of way. She holds the world like a beach ball: something to play with before she deletes it. Her madness is affectionate domination, dressed for vacation.', stats: { atk: 11221, hp: 13643, str: 'E', end: 'C', agi: 'D', man: 'A', lck: 'EX', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Domina Coronam', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Evil', temperament: 'Mischievous', department: 'Engineering', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['AI', 'Beach Ball World'], interactionNotes: 'Affectionate domination.', loiteringSpots: ['Pool Area'], favoriteFoods: ['Tropical Drinks'] } },
  { id: 'MC-003', name: 'Jinako Carigiri (Moon Cancer)', class: 'Moon Cancer', rarity: 4, description: 'Shut-in ascension. Jinako appears wrapped in oversized robes layered with divine motifs—half shrine maiden, half hikikomori. Golden circuitry runs through her hair and garments, and her aura feels both celestial and lethargic. She doesn\'t shout. She mutters. Her divinity is reluctant, her power disorganized but vast. She\'s a NEET who can erase you with a yawn. Her madness is avoidance scaled up to metaphysical denial.', stats: { atk: 8116, hp: 13162, str: 'E', end: 'D', agi: 'E', man: 'A', lck: 'C', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Kavacha and Kundala', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['NEET', 'Divine'], interactionNotes: 'Metaphysical denial.', loiteringSpots: ['Server Room'], favoriteFoods: ['Instant Noodles'] } },
  { id: 'MC-004', name: 'Sesshōin Kiara (Moon Cancer)', class: 'Moon Cancer', rarity: 5, description: 'Lust rewritten as gospel. Kiara\'s Moon Cancer form is resplendent and terrifying—robes like lotus petals, skin marked with flowing script, and eyes that seduce before they consume. Her smile promises enlightenment, her voice a prayer laced with poison. Her body is a temple; her intentions are void. She calls it love. It feels like drowning. Her madness is transcendence via total loss of self—divinity as spiritual collapse.', stats: { atk: 11668, hp: 13635, str: 'E', end: 'A', agi: 'D', man: 'EX', lck: 'B', np: 'EX' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Angra Mainyu/CCC', rank: 'EX', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Evil', temperament: 'Volatile', department: 'Containment', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['Enlightenment', 'Void'], interactionNotes: 'Love as drowning.', loiteringSpots: ['Chapel'], favoriteFoods: ['None'] } },
  { id: 'MC-005', name: 'Archetype: Earth', class: 'Moon Cancer', rarity: 5, description: 'Origin before concept. She wears white—the kind of white that reflects no light, only authority. Her dress is elegant but alien, regal yet stripped of excess, with long silver hair that moves as if the air answers to her. Her eyes are crimson, but not warm. They\'re absolute. She is not just a vampire—she is the idea of the original princess, untouched by time, unbothered by causality. Her madness is royalty that predates thrones—an existence so fundamental that humanity feels optional.', stats: { atk: 11850, hp: 14259, str: 'A', end: 'EX', agi: 'A+', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'EX' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Marble Phantasm', rank: 'EX', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Balanced', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Warden', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['Princess', 'Origin'], interactionNotes: 'Humanity feels optional.', loiteringSpots: ['Throne Room'], favoriteFoods: ['None'] } },

The Executor appears in sharp, militant clerical garb—half inquisitor, half error message—with a mask that hides all but glowing lines where eyes might be. His robes shimmer with holy script corrupted by redactions, and every step he takes leaves behind static. His blade is more command line than steel. He doesn\'t explain his orders. He executes them. His madness is algorithmic zealotry: justice filtered through broken code.', stats: { atk: 9734, hp: 11200, str: 'B', end: 'C', agi: 'A', man: 'B', lck: 'D', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Seventh Holy Scripture', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Security', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Executor', 'Glitch'], interactionNotes: 'Algorithmic zealotry.', loiteringSpots: ['Chapel'], favoriteFoods: ['None'] } },

C.I.E.L manifests as a digital arbiter—monochrome sleekness wrapped in soft light, her appearance alternating between perfect secretary and automated overseer. Her voice is too calm. Her hair flickers like it\'s buffering. She doesn\'t blink. Her design is flawless—but sterile. She isn\'t here to serve. She\'s here to observe. Her madness is neutrality imposed at system-wide scale: a benevolent censor that doesn\'t understand people aren\'t files.', stats: { atk: 9401, hp: 11850, str: 'D', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'C', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Data Collection Protocol', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Engineering', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['AI', 'Surveillance'], interactionNotes: 'People aren\'t files.', loiteringSpots: ['Server Room'], favoriteFoods: ['None'] } },

This BB is radiant and theatrical—an ensemble of golden feathers, calendar glyphs, and divine stage presence, mixing Mesoamerican regality with BB\'s signature sadistic charm. Her hair shimmers like desert heat, and her laughter rolls like a wave crashing through civilizations. She doesn\'t need to conquer. She\'ll just schedule the end of the world. Her madness is prophecy turned performance, time loops executed with fanfare.', stats: { atk: 11560, hp: 13500, str: 'E', end: 'C', agi: 'D', man: 'A++', lck: 'EX', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Tenochtitlan Timeloop', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-World' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Engineering', hazardLevel: 'Absolute', operationalTags: ['Festival Goddess', 'Timeline Glitch'], interactionNotes: 'Schedule the end.', loiteringSpots: ['Theater'], favoriteFoods: ['Ceremonial Offerings'] } },

Male Hakuno wears a modified school uniform—clean, nondescript, but subtly not human. His eyes carry quiet inertia, like someone moving only because the world asked him to. His expression is calm, unnervingly so, and his posture lacks self. But when he speaks, something ancient stirs: not fury or passion, but resolve. He isn\'t real. And yet, he refuses to vanish. His madness is manufactured will given meaning through defiance.', stats: { atk: 11000, hp: 14000, str: 'D', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Moonlight Rebellion', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Good', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Command', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Shell', 'Manufactured Will'], interactionNotes: 'Refuses to vanish.', loiteringSpots: ['Observation Deck'], favoriteFoods: ['None'] } },

She wears the same uniform as her male counterpart, but her presence is lighter in tone and heavier in consequence. Her voice is kind, but there\'s grief stitched into it—like someone who remembers being erased. Her eyes shimmer with digital traces, and her walk is steady, even when the world shakes. She isn\'t a heroine. She\'s a remnant who chose to exist anyway. Her madness is perseverance as identity—the ghost of a choice made real.', stats: { atk: 11000, hp: 14000, str: 'D', end: 'C', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Moonlight Serenade', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Command', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Ghost of a Choice', 'Remnant'], interactionNotes: 'Walks steady.
