She still favors her first-stage look: the familiar Puritan dress—neat, old-fashioned, and a little too carefully maintained—now made unmistakably hers by the way the arcane stitching sits like personal handwriting rather than a brand. The pale hair, the bows, the soft face that makes people underestimate her: all still there, but the feeling is different up close. Her eyes don\'t scream "monster." They say "I\'ve had to be brave for a long time," and they stay gentle anyway. The staff remains keylike—less a weapon than a promise that if something is sealed, she can find the seam. She prays in the way someone speaks to a familiar room, and the stars respond with the same calm inevitability they always did.', stats: { atk: 12100, hp: 14000, str: 'B', end: 'A', agi: 'C', man: 'B', lck: 'C', np: 'EX' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Qliphoth Rhizome', rank: 'EX', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Good', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Extreme', operationalTags: ['Key Bearer', 'Gentle Spiral', 'Frostling'], interactionNotes: 'Steady, soft-spoken, unnervingly composed.

  { id: 'F-002', name: 'Katsushika Hokusai', class: 'Foreigner', rarity: 5, description: 'Hokusai doesn\'t need a rewrite—she arrived already built like an argument against normalcy. She\'s still ink and tide and laughter, still a girl and not a girl in that very specific way that makes people pause mid-sentence. The kimono stays perpetually ink-stained like she\'s been leaning against wet canvases her whole life, and that one sleeve behaves like it\'s remembering the ocean—rippling, curling, occasionally swelling as if a wave is testing the edge of the world. Her hair tied up with paper charms that flutter with every movement, not in the way paper should flutter, but like brushstrokes peeling off a painting and returning to the air as living calligraphy. She laughs—bright, mischievous, delighted by the idea that art can be weaponized, soothed, weaponized again, and then turned into a snack if the day calls for it. Toto-sama, perched like an eldritch familiar with grandfather privileges, pushes her toward Kyle constantly—tentacle-nudging, stage-whisper advice, absolutely the worst possible wingman.', stats: { atk: 11781, hp: 12965, str: 'E', end: 'D', agi: 'B', man: 'A', lck: 'B', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'High', operationalTags: ['Void Artist', 'Painter', 'Father-Daughter Combo'], interactionNotes: 'Crush expresses through art first.

MHXX wears a form-fitting sci-fi suit complete with oversized visor, tactical gear, and an anti-planet-class laser sword she barely knows how to justify. She\'s bubbly, exhausted, and determined to stop the "Foreigner Threat" even though she is one. Her madness is bureaucratic irony: someone sent to contain what\'s already infected her. The laugh track? That\'s her trying to cope.', stats: { atk: 9258, hp: 11882, str: 'C', end: 'B', agi: 'A', man: 'D', lck: 'A', np: 'B' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Etherspace, Howbeit the Order', rank: 'B', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Lawful Good', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Security', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Space Cop', 'Saber Hunter', 'Bureaucratic Irony'], interactionNotes: 'Bubbly but exhausted.

Her first-stage form hasn\'t changed in silhouette—she keeps the translucent qipao with celestial motifs, lotus-flame patterns that look painted on but behave like living light, and ribbons that drift with the slow physics of a dream rather than the air of a hallway. Her skin keeps that restrained, ember-under-ash glow, but it no longer reads as purely "sealed danger"; it reads as composure, a deliberate containment that\'s proud of itself. Her personality has sharpened into a particular kind of refined honesty that catches people off guard, because it looks like poise but it\'s actually longing that\'s learned manners. She\'s less shy now, less apologetic about existing. She loves Kyle because his attention doesn\'t try to own what it touches—for someone who has lived under the weight of "divine possession reframed as fate," that kind of non-demanding regard is intoxicating.', stats: { atk: 11546, hp: 14406, str: 'E', end: 'E', agi: 'C', man: 'A', lck: 'B', np: 'B+' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Gēwǔ Shēngpíng', rank: 'B+', type: 'Anti-Unit' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Balanced', temperament: 'Cheerful', department: 'Support', hazardLevel: 'Extreme', operationalTags: ['Imperial Consort', 'Lotus Flame', 'Refined Magnetism'], interactionNotes: 'Refined honesty.

His gaze is calm, his tone soft, his movements precise in the way a satellite drifts—constant, inevitable. His presence brings comfort and unease: the stars love you, but they don\'t know you. His madness is purity without grounding—a soul built to explore, but not to return.', stats: { atk: 10546, hp: 12177, str: 'E', end: 'E', agi: 'B', man: 'EX', lck: 'A+', np: 'A' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'Voyager of the Stars', rank: 'A', type: 'Anti-Humanity' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Neutral Good', temperament: 'Stoic', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Moderate', operationalTags: ['Golden Record', 'Satellite Soul', 'Explorer'], interactionNotes: 'Calm, soft-spoken, precise.

Summer Abby trades Puritan garb for a frilly, dark blue swimsuit adorned with seashells that faintly glow with sigils, while her parasol pulses with uncanny warmth. Her smile is brighter, her voice sweeter—but the stars still twitch when she laughs. She tries so hard to seem normal, and that trying is what makes her alien.

She\'s kept in her first-stage form most of the time: a petite, pale girl with that too-young "child" impression, messy pale-blond hair that sticks out in uneven tufts like thick brushstrokes that never fully dried, and big expressive eyes that can\'t decide whether they want to be luminous or frightened. She wears the oversized white smock-dress stained with oil paint like it\'s both armor and apology, and she hauls around the comically large paintbrush that doubles as a weapon and a comfort object. Kyle sat her down and treated the identity crisis like a problem you solve by building a stable name to stand on. She paints Kyle constantly, sometimes obsessively—not in the creepy "idol" way but in the desperate "if I can capture you, maybe you won\'t vanish" way.', stats: { atk: 11224, hp: 15000, str: 'E', end: 'B', agi: 'C', man: 'A', lck: 'A', np: 'A+' }, noblePhantasm: { name: 'De Sterrennacht', rank: 'A+', type: 'Anti-Army' }, metadata: { alignment: 'Chaotic Good', temperament: 'Volatile', department: 'Research', hazardLevel: 'Extreme', operationalTags: ['Patchwork Soul', 'Artist', 'Goghk One-Liners'], interactionNotes: 'Laughs constantly ("ufufu," "ehehe") to keep from tipping into panic.

MIXXA is a dazzling contradiction—her outfit fuses idol aesthetics with sci-fi armor, her mic doubling as a weapon that autotunes her hymns into anti-memetic pulses. Her every movement is choreographed, her smile professionally perfect. But behind the act, there\'s static. She isn\'t performing. She is the performance.

Her skin radiates sun-heat even when she\'s calm, and her voice echoes with harmonic layers—as if multiple timelines agreed to say the same thing.
